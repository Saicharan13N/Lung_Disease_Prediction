# TODO List for UI Improvements

## Metrics Dashboard Rearrangement
- [x] Move all graphs/images to the top (training curves, confusion matrix, ROC curves, model architecture)
- [x] Place training details text section below graphs
- [x] Move confusion matrix table to the bottom

## Prediction Section Optimization
- [x] Limit causes, symptoms, precautions to 3-4 items each
- [x] Remove risk level indicator (high/medium/low)
- [x] Add prediction confidence meter/progress bar

## UI Clarity Improvements
- [x] Use tabs for different dashboard sections
- [x] Improve column layouts
- [x] Add better section headers

## Testing
- [x] Run Streamlit app to verify changes work correctly

## Additional UI Improvements
- [x] Elaborate model summary with detailed architecture, training config, and statistics

## Suggested Features (Future)
- [ ] Interactive metric charts
- [ ] Export metrics to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Collapsible sections
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
